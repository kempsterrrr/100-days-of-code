# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 27th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Set up Node.js Chat Bot project on the [Microsoft Bot framework](https://dev.botframework.com/). Added welcome message and started main dialog.

**Thoughts:** Relatively steep learning curve as this is the first node project I have set up via the terminal with npm. Learnt about package.json and dependecies. The docs an Bot framework are excellent but there are not many tutorials online. This turned about to be very good learning how to understand documentation. I also learnt about restify and some very basic stuff about Azure cloud hosting; set up my account and deployment via github although I have not got this working properly. Bot is running succesfully on a brilliant emulator tool the MS team provide. Really fun few hours of coding in node though.

**Link to work:** Can't provide as working private repo.
