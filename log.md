# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 27th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Set up Node.js Chat Bot project on the [Microsoft Bot framework](https://dev.botframework.com/)

**Thoughts:** Relatively steep learning vurve as first full node projects I have set up via the terminal with NPM. Learn about package.json and dependecies. The docs an Bot framework are excellent but there are few tutorials online. This turned about to be very good learning for understand documentation. Also learnt what restify is and some very basic stuff about Azure cloud hosting, set up my account and deployment via github although not got this work properly. Bot is running succesfully on a brilliant emulator tool the MS team provide. Really fund few hours of coding in node.

**Link to work:** Can't provide as working private repo.
