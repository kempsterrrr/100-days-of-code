# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 16: February 13th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More learning on Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript track, specifically DOM manipulation. Also set up project for new vanilla javascript to do app

**Thoughts:** Was interesting to learn more about the complexities that frameworks and libraries remove from writing everyday JavaScript applications, going to impliment this learning to build a vanilla js to do app.

### Day 15: February 12th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: A lot of JavaScript learning on Treehouse and some messing around on my React portfolio

**Thoughts:** trying to develop without paying full attention is furstrating

### Day 14: February 11th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Missed yesterday out with work, clocked up 3 hours this morning working on React portfolio though - nailed the mobile first navigation and started on the header Section

**Thoughts:** Getting more and more comfortabel with the modular approach to react and actually have success with CSS/SCSS! ðŸ˜Ž

### Day 13: February 9th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started my portfolio that will be sharing on Github Pages at some point. Doing this with react as well

**Thoughts:** Getting quite fluid with using react, nothing has gotten that complex yet and no state management etc. but feeling food.

### Day 12: February 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the home page for the rec site I work for. Really satisfying.

**Thoughts:** Design does not seem to come to me naturally. Choosing fonts, background images etc. is all def harder than writing JavaScript !

**Link to work:** I'll put a photo up and change this soon

### Day 11: February 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More on the React concept site for the recruitment company I work for

**Thoughts:** Learning more but was doing so on a train in the moring and after a couple of glass of wine in the evening. Didn't really sink in so back to more serious work tomorrow.

**Link to work:** Private Repo still for this one

### Day 10: February 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Braved a new world working with react outside of a guided tutorial

**Thoughts:** Building the ToDo app with React was rewarding but building something from scratch is much for fun. Challenge my understanding of the concepts I had learnt but using the tutorial as a guide I really start to understand how to use the library. Comfortbaly now using mouldar components and setting up Router/Route for the app. Really fun

**Link to work:** Private Repo still for this one

--

### Day 9: February 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: A lot of time on the bacis's of CSS layouts and starting on flex-box

**Thoughts:** Nothing more annoying than getting a React application running and starting to build components with 0 ability to add remotely athestically pleasing styling

**Link to work:** Private repo! I will sort this out at somet point but all my projects are sensitive at the moment.

--

### Day 8: February 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished React Todo app, ran through a few more project configs using React, SASS, Babel and WebPack - started a concept site for the recruitmnet businss I work for

**Thoughts:** Starting actually get the hand of webpack and react. Nothing to complex with React yet but lots of fun and really interesting learning about how to strucutre apps rather than sites and how to re-use/modularise code for better maintainance and upgrades

**Link to work:** I will upload this and share it later, finally! 

--

### Day 7: February 2nd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued the React Todo app. Learned about proprs, state, input refs and styled components

**Thoughts:** Huge amount of fun had tonight. Love how simple the principles of React are, I was following a tutorial but I feel like I could right my own simple app already - very cool

--

### Day 6: February 1st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started React todo app using the Net Ninja tutorials on Youtube. Set up my first React project using webpack and made my frist component

**Thoughts:** Really interesting learning more about webpack and can see how the basic's of react work now too. Need to get more sleep it was really hard to concentrate

--

### Day 5: January 31st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Back on the node chat bot today with MS bot fraemwork. I tested it on someone else and it failed misrably, starting all over again :)

**Thoughts:** This thought me a lot about testing things and being explicit when writing code

**Link to work:** Still on a private repo :/...

--

### Day 4: January 30th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I ran through the set up of webpack, bable and sass again to set up my new protfoli/github pages project

**Thoughts:** getting used to the terminal and it's making everything much easier and faster as well as getting me used to dealing with error and just understand how the terminal works

**Link to work:** Another private repo! Going to finish my portfolio and then share eventually

--

### Day 3: January 29th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Some work on the node.js recruitment chat bot. More time spent learnning webpack and a start on SASS

**Thoughts:** Starting to get the feel for npm, dependencies and working from the terminal. Yet to really dive into SASS but the features feel way more like a programming language which is good as I have never been a huge fan of CSS

**Link to work:** Working from a prviate repo

### Day 2: January 28th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Node.js recruitment.

**Thoughts:** Challenging working out how the different chat [Dialogs](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/node/builder/chat/dialogs/) work but very interesting.

**Link to work:** Can't provide as working private repo. I will publish eventually, promise :)

### Day 1: January 27th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Set up Node.js Chat Bot project on the [Microsoft Bot framework](https://dev.botframework.com/). Added welcome message and started main dialog.

**Thoughts:** Relatively steep learning curve as this is the first node project I have set up via the terminal with npm. Learnt about package.json and dependecies. The docs an Bot framework are excellent but there are not many tutorials online. This turned about to be very good learning how to understand documentation. I also learnt about restify and some very basic stuff about Azure cloud hosting; set up my account and deployment via github although I have not got this working properly. Bot is running succesfully on a brilliant emulator tool the MS team provide. Really fun few hours of coding in node though.

**Link to work:** Can't provide as working private repo.
