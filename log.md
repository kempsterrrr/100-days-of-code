# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: January 29th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Some work on the node.js recruitment chat bot. More time spent learnning webpack and a start on SASS

**Thoughts:** Starting to get the feel for npm, dependencies and working from the terminal. Yet to really dive into SASS but the features feel way more like a programming language which is good as I have never been a huge fan of CSS

**Link to work:** Working from a prviate repo

### Day 2: January 28th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Node.js recruitment.

**Thoughts:** Challenging working out how the different chat [Dialogs](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/node/builder/chat/dialogs/) work but very interesting.

**Link to work:** Can't provide as working private repo. I will publish eventually, promise :)

### Day 1: January 27th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Set up Node.js Chat Bot project on the [Microsoft Bot framework](https://dev.botframework.com/). Added welcome message and started main dialog.

**Thoughts:** Relatively steep learning curve as this is the first node project I have set up via the terminal with npm. Learnt about package.json and dependecies. The docs an Bot framework are excellent but there are not many tutorials online. This turned about to be very good learning how to understand documentation. I also learnt about restify and some very basic stuff about Azure cloud hosting; set up my account and deployment via github although I have not got this working properly. Bot is running succesfully on a brilliant emulator tool the MS team provide. Really fun few hours of coding in node though.
