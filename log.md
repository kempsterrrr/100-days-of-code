# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 7: February 2nd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued the React Todo app. Learn about proprs, state, input refs and styled components

**Thoughts:** Huge amount of had tonight. Love how simple the principles are that reat, I was following a tutorial but I feel like I could right my own simple app already - very cool

### Day 6: February 1st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started React todo app using the Net Ninja tutorials on Youtube. Set up my first React project using webpack and made my frist component

**Thoughts:** Really interesting learning more about webpack and can see how the basic's of react work now too. Need to get more sleep it was really hard to concentrate

### Day 5: January 31st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Back on the node chat bot today with MS bot fraemwork. I tested it on someone else and it failed misrably, starting all over again :)

**Thoughts:** This thought me a lot about testing things and being explicit when writing code

### Day 4: January 30th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I ran through the set up of webpack, bable and sass again to set up my new protfoli/github pages project

**Thoughts:** getting used to the terminal and it's making everything much easier and faster as well as getting me used to dealing with error and just understand how the terminal works

**Link to work:** Another private repo! Going to finish my portfolio and then share eventually

### Day 3: January 29th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Some work on the node.js recruitment chat bot. More time spent learnning webpack and a start on SASS

**Thoughts:** Starting to get the feel for npm, dependencies and working from the terminal. Yet to really dive into SASS but the features feel way more like a programming language which is good as I have never been a huge fan of CSS

**Link to work:** Working from a prviate repo

### Day 2: January 28th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Node.js recruitment.

**Thoughts:** Challenging working out how the different chat [Dialogs](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/node/builder/chat/dialogs/) work but very interesting.

**Link to work:** Can't provide as working private repo. I will publish eventually, promise :)

### Day 1: January 27th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Set up Node.js Chat Bot project on the [Microsoft Bot framework](https://dev.botframework.com/). Added welcome message and started main dialog.

**Thoughts:** Relatively steep learning curve as this is the first node project I have set up via the terminal with npm. Learnt about package.json and dependecies. The docs an Bot framework are excellent but there are not many tutorials online. This turned about to be very good learning how to understand documentation. I also learnt about restify and some very basic stuff about Azure cloud hosting; set up my account and deployment via github although I have not got this working properly. Bot is running succesfully on a brilliant emulator tool the MS team provide. Really fun few hours of coding in node though.

**Link to work:** Can't provide as working private repo.
